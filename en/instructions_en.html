                <p>The Wonder Quest is designed so that you can create an interesting treasure hunt by yourself. It is a combination of real and virtual environment. The real environment is the area where the search will take place (house, school, playground, park...). In the virtual environment there is a treasure map, instructions that guide the game, random stories and tasks that will make the quest more exciting. You can play the same quest multiple times, and experience it in a different way each time.</p>
                <p>The game should be played under the guidance of an adult who will guide the child and clarify any ambiguities. This version is made for children 3-5 years old. The tasks can, of course, be adjusted as needed by the adult. </p>
                <p>The Wonder Quest stimulates imagination, develops analytical thinking, spatial orientation, encourages observation of details, strengthens self-confidence and positive self-image.</p>

                <h2 class="mini-heading">SETTING UP THE GAME</h2>
                <p>In order to play, you must first set up the game (SET GAME in main menu). You (adult) set up clues to guide a player (child) to the next location.</p>
                
                <h3>CLUES</h3>
                <p>You set the clues virtually. If you want, you can also leave them in real locations, but it is not necessary. You can set a maximum of 10 clues that will lead to up to 10 locations and minimum of 2 clues. You can set them in two ways:</p>
                <ol class="flex">
                   <li>A description</li>
                   <p>Describe the location you want to player to go to. You can describe it also in a cryptic and creative way. Examples: a) What you sleep on, blue (bed); b) From Monday to Friday, many children hang out, play and study there (school)</p>
                   <li>Three associations</li>
                   <p>Use three associations to create a clue for the next location. Examples: a) Grass, swing, children (children's playground); b) graphite, a4, chair (workroom/desk)</p>
                </ol>

                <h3>LOCATIONS</h3>
                <p>Locations are real places where the search takes place, that is, places to which clues lead. You design the locations by yourself. You can set them to be in a smaller (eg house) or larger area (eg park) depending on your wishes. For example, this could be a treasure hunt path: a bed, a basement, a couch, a kindergarten, a park, a garage. You can set a maximum of 10 locations and a minimum of 2 (not counting the initial location).</p>
                <p>Each real location is linked to a virtual location, i.e. a virtual story and tasks. So, although you are really at the couch, you can imagine yourself being actually in a magical forest meeting a wizard.</p>
                <p>Virtual locations are located on a virtual treasure map. They are created after you start the game. They are marked with a colored circle. Clicking on the circle opens a window with a specific story and instructions on how to act in that story. An adult can adjust the story and tasks for the child if necessary.</p>
                 
                <h3>CODE</h3>
                <p>You also design the code by yourself. You must enter it for each location (except the starting one) before starting the game. It is used so that the player can confirm arrival at the correct location. Optionally, you can ask a question that will help the player figure out the code.</p>
                <p>You can physically leave the code at the location, or it can be something specific to that location. Example: a) the last three numbers of the barcode; b) from the location it can be seen to the south, the stone (statue) is also large; c) the color of the bed cover.</p>

                <h2 class="mini-heading">GAME</h2>
                <p>After the clues are placed, the game can begin (START GAME). The real hunt happens through real locations, and the virtual one through the adventure map. The game should take place under the guidance of an adult who reads to the child and guides him gradually. If necessary, the adult adapts the story and tasks to the child.</p>
                <p>By clicking on the first colored field, the hunt begins. An adult reads a story and instructions to a child and they gradually follow them together. In order to get to the treasure, it is necessary to go through all the stories and tasks in all locations.</p>
                
                <h3>STORY AND TASKS</h3>
                <p>A random story happens with each location. It is necessary to imagine how the story unfolds in reality. So instead of a couch in front of the player, there could be an enchanted forest. The player (child) is asked to participate in the story. The instructions for participation are highlighted in a different color than the rest of the text. Sometimes it is a physical or mental activity, sometimes a conversation with an imaginary or real character. Sometimes props are required to participate. They can be real, but they can also be imagined. For example, instead of a real sword, a branch can be used, or a rolled-up newspaper, or even an entirely imaginary sword in hand. If necessary, activities, props and story can be adapted by an adult to the child's circumstances and abilities. </p>

                <h3>NEW LOCATION</h3>
                <p>Using clues (placed by an adult before the start of the game), the player figures out locations and gets to them. When arriving at a new location, you should first click on the new colored glowing field. Then you need to enter the correct code, and then follow the further story and instructions.</p>
                
                <h3>TREASURE</h3>
                <p>The last location on the virtual map is at the place marked with the letter "X". There is a treasure. In the real location, the treasure will be whatever you leave there. It can be a lost toy, pajamas or a toothbrush before going to bed, candy, tickets to a game, a hug or just a compliment and expression of satisfaction for a nice time spent together. We recommend that the emphasis be more on bonding with the child and praise for effort than on something material. </p>
