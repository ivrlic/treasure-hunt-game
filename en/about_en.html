                <p>Ivan is a husband and father of two kids. He likes nature, taking apart devices, risotto with chicken and spending time with his loved ones. One of his happier pastimes with others is a play. Play with toys, play without toys, imagination play, role play, social play, play in the house, play in nature, every possible play. Among them, the search for treasure takes a special place. Children especially loved that classic. It's nice to do something exciting together with them. Go through obstacles together and get closer. Why not share it with other parents? That's how the <span>The Wonder Quest</span> was born.</p>
                <p>You can expect a new improved version of the game in the future.</p>
                <p>You can send all questions, suggestions and criticisms to <a href = "#" onclick='window.open("mailto: ivrlic@gmail.com");return false;'>ivrlic@gmail.com</a >. I look forward to any contact.</p>
